# WIPMaker
You pick a target file, and the WIPMaker will be saving copys of it from time to time, if it was changed. I did it to save my pixel art's progression while i am drawing, so i can to do a WIP(Work in Progress) gif at the end of work. However, i tested it with text files too, and it worked.
